        We are in complete solidarity with the people of Palestine and their resistance to zionism. As such, CuteLab commits to the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi">Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel</a>a> (PACBI), a part of the wider Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
    </p>
    <p class="longform">
        This means CuteLab will not sponsor any cultural events funded by zionist institutions, nor will it exhibit, present, showcase, or promote them or their work. More generally, we demand an end to all forms of institutional exchange with the Israeli occupation.
    </p>
    <p class="longform">
        We are making this statement to encourage people to consider the sources of funding for artistic venues, and by doing so to collectively put pressure on larger venues. We also urge all artists and institutions to join the boycott. You can read more about PACBI here.
