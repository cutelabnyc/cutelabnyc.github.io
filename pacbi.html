        In solidarity with the Palestinian people, we at CuteLab commit to complying with the guidelines of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI). There are plenty of places on the internet where you can <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi/cultural-boycott-guidelines">read about what this means</a>â€”in short we are boycotting events and activities funded by the state of Israel, refusing material support from the state of Israel, and making this statement.
    </p>
    <p class="longform">
        Materially, what does this boycott actually mean for us? After all, CuteLab does not <em>sponsor any cultural events funded by an official Israeli body</em>, nor do we <em>collaborate or cooperate with complicit Israeli institutions</em>. At the end of the day, this boycott doesn't change very much about how we operate. However, we feel that joining the boycott is more than a token gesture. In making this statement public, we want to stand in solidarity with other institutions that have made a similar commitment, and to insist that larger, more influential institutions do the same.
    </p>
    <p class="longform">
        We want to close by saying that this is not about boycotting individuals based on their opinion or their identity. This is about the policies and actions of the Israeli state, which we believe are unjust and oppressive. Lastly, it's about reminding audiences and venues both to think about who pays for the art they consume and promote.
    </p>
    <p class="longform">
        We hope the reasoning behind our decision is clear, and we urge any artist or art instutions considering joining the boycott to do so.
