        We are in complete solidarity with the people of Palestine and their resistance to zionism. As such, CuteLab commits to the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/pacbi">Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel</a> (PACBI), a part of the wider Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
    </p>
    <p class="longform">
        This means CuteLab will not sponsor any cultural events funded by zionist institutions, nor will it exhibit, present, showcase, or promote them or their work. More generally, we demand an end to all forms of institutional exchange with the Israeli occupation.

    <p class="longform">
        We urge all artists and institutions to join the boycott and hope that making this statement will encourage further consideration into the funding of artistic venues in New York City. Such considerations will inevitably put more pressure on larger venues.
